 * possible at all.
 *
 * The two carry different state on purpose: a timeoutPromise reports its cancellation through a
 * rejection and an AbortSignal, a lazyPromise reports its outcome through resolved, error and value.

/**
 * Builds a promise together with the two functions settling it.
 *
 * The point is to have the promise and its resolve and reject apart from each other: whatever
 * settles it does not have to sit inside the executor. That keeps a promise usable where the
 * settling is driven by a framework callback, an event or any other foreign code the executor has no
 * way of reaching.
 *
 * The promise carries three read only properties:
 *
 * - resolved says the promise has been settled. It says nothing about the outcome - it is true for a
 *   failure just as well.
 * - error tells the two apart.
 * - value holds whatever the promise was settled with: the result after a resolve, the reason after
 *   a reject. error is what decides how to read it.
 *
 * An Error always leads to a rejection, in both directions - handing one to resolve rejects the
 * promise just like reject would. A reason that is no Error is wrapped into one, and a reject
 * without a reason gets an Error of its own, so there is always a message to read.
 *
 * Both functions settle the promise once. A second call throws instead of settling again, so the
 * three properties can never end up disagreeing with the promise.
 *
 * @returns {Promise} a promise carrying resolve(), reject(), value, error and resolved
 * @throws {Error} from resolve or reject when the promise has already been settled
 *
 * @example
 * const promise = lazyPromise();
 * element.addEventListener("load", () => promise.resolve(element), {once : true});
 * await promise;
 *
 * @example
 * const promise = lazyPromise();
 * promise.reject("no connection");   // rejects with an Error carrying that message
 * promise.resolved;                  // true - settled, not successful
 * promise.error;                     // true
 * promise.value;                     // "no connection"
