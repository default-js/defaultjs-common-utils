 * instead of escaping into the timer.
 *
 * The promise brings its own AbortController. cancel() clears a pending timeout and rejects with an
 * AbortError, which travels down the whole chain - no then handler behind it runs. cancel() sits on
 * every promise derived from it and does nothing once the promise has settled.

 * @param {Function} fn called with (resolve, reject, signal) once the timeout has passed
 * @param {number} ms the timeout in milliseconds
 * @returns {Promise} a promise carrying cancel(), signal and canceled
 *
 * @example
 * const promise = timeoutPromise((resolve) => resolve("done"), 1000);
 * await promise;                                  // "done"
 *
 * @example
 * const promise = timeoutPromise((resolve) => resolve("done"), 1000);
 * promise.then(() => console.log("never runs"));
 * promise.cancel();
